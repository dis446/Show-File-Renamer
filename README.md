Automatically renames your shows to a specific format at 12am!

Requirements:  
python 3.5 (unknown if it works on older versions but it should)

Run this script in your show folder and it will automatically rename all files to "Title SnumberEnumber.filename" at 12:00am/24:00 everyday!
Created this for fun.
